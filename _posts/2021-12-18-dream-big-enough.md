"Wisdom is to have dreams big enough not to lose sight of them when we pursue them" - Oscar Wilde.

The first step is to have a dream. Many people don't reach this step, and it is the root of most existential angst. In the workplace, you should set your own goals and agenda, or else your boss will set one for you that's not in your best interest. In society, if you don't have a dream, then society will mold a cookie-cutter, conventional life for you. You will let others dictate your life.

The next step is dream big enough. If the dream can be accomplished in less than a year, then it's probably not big enough to set as a life mission. Always think ahead to the long term.
