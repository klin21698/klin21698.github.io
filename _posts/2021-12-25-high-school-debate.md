I've watched a few videos on high school debate, and I think they missed the mark on the point of debate.

My first complaint is that the contest format encourages "spreading". Competitors often speak very quickly at 300+ words per minute in order to voice all their arguments. I suppose this is a necessary evil, because if you aren't doing this, then the competitor will, and you'll lose because the competitor has voiced more arguments. 

The problem is that I can't take these arguments seriously if I can't understand them. Sure, if I were to study how to process words at 300+ words per minute, I'd be able to understand them, but only crazy people would want to learn to understand "spreading" in their free time. It'd be better to add a penalty for incoherent speech.

My second complaint is more trivial, and it's that the debaters don't look at each other. I've seen a few videos of the debaters standing side-by-side and looking ahead at the judges as they debate. In the real world, you need to make eye contact during conversations, business meetings, negotiations, etc.

Winning debates in this format doesn't seem to be an achievement worth having.
