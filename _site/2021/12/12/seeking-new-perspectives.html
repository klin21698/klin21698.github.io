    <h1>Seeking New Perspectives</h1>
<p>12 Dec 2021 - levalyn</p>

<p>Some of the most common advice for people in their 20s is to travel the world, try out different jobs, date around to find what kind of person you like, etc.</p>

<p>When a PhD student has spent the month bashing his head over a problem, he will approach his advisor, and the solution will often come easily because the advisor leads the student down an entirely different path.</p>

<p>The common denominator of these examples is that sometimes the best approach is to try something completely different. We can spend all of our efforts exhausting our existing knowledge, but that limits us from gaining any new knowledge. Perhaps the better way forward is to expand our knowledge, so we have a better idea of what else is out there.</p>

<p>In the case of the advice to travel the world, to try out different jobs, and to date around, it is not certain what we will gain out of the experience beforehand. But that is the point. By exploring the unknown, we will expand our horizons in meaningful and unexpected ways.</p>

<p>As an anecdotal example, one of my hobbies is learning languages. Learning languages is much more than learning vocabulary and grammar. When you study a language, you study the culture, history, and mentality of a people because these permeate into the creation and evolution of the language.</p>

<p>In English, stating your age such as in the sentence, “I am 20 years old”, is done by the “to be” construction, suggesting that a person’s is a characteristic or attribute of a person. Contrast this with Spanish, in which you would instead say “I have 20 years old” or with Russian, in which you would say something to the effect of “20 years is happening to me.” In Spanish, age is an external object which you can possess, and in Russian, age is some abstract thing that acts on you.</p>

<p>(Erich Fromm’s To Have or To Be discusses this aspect of language in more detail in one of the sections in his philosophical thesis on the ideal mode of existence.)</p>

<p>I cannot exactly pinpoint how the above difference between English, Spanish, and Russian has influenced me. If I were forced to answer with something, I would sputter some gibberish… rethinking the active versus passive relationship with natural phenomena such as age… individualistic view of self in English versus relational view of self in Russian… I’m not really sure…</p>

<p>It is impossible to exactly say how this example affects or benefits me, but the point is that the sum of the small tidbits of language and culture has led me to a different way of thinking. In my personal life, I find this process of discovering new perspectives challenging yet immensely enjoyable. In the workplace and in society, I find that I am often able to bring a diverse perspective to the table.</p>
