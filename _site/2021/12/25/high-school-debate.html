      <h1>High School Debate</h1>
<p>25 Dec 2021 - levalyn</p>

<p>I’ve watched a few videos on high school debate, and I think they missed the mark on the point of debate.</p>

<p>My first complaint is that the contest format encourages “spreading”. Competitors often speak very quickly at 300+ words per minute in order to voice all their arguments. I suppose this is a necessary evil, because if you aren’t doing this, then the competitor will, and you’ll lose because the competitor has voiced more arguments.</p>

<p>The problem is that I can’t take these arguments seriously if I can’t understand them. Sure, if I were to study how to process words at 300+ words per minute, I’d be able to understand them, but only crazy people would want to learn to understand “spreading” in their free time. It’d be better to add a penalty for incoherent speech.</p>

<p>My second complaint is more trivial, and it’s that the debaters don’t look at each other. I’ve seen a few videos of the debaters standing side-by-side and looking ahead at the judges as they debate. In the real world, you need to make eye contact during conversations, business meetings, negotiations, etc.</p>

<p>Winning debates in this format doesn’t seem to be an achievement worth having.</p>
