      <h1>Is Marriage Still Sacred</h1>
<p>06 Dec 2021 - levalyn</p>

<p>The market economy is the dominant economic force in the Western world. It dictates that supply and demand are the main drivers behind price. This is a fairly intuitive idea - the more sellers of a particular item, the lower the price. And the more buyers, the higher the price.</p>

<p>For almost every imaginable thing in the world, there is a market for it. Food, housing, stocks, cell phones, water, etc. If you were to take survey of every item in your house, you would find that the vast majority of items have a market for them. If they didn’t, how did you buy them?</p>

<p>Perhaps, the item is some handwoven scarf given as a gift from your grandmother, so it was never bought on the market. But even then, the yarn used in that scarf had to be bought somewhere. And if you wanted to sell the scarf, it would go for some amount on the handmade or secondhand market.</p>

<p>What about something more abstract like the marriage market? From an evolutionary perspective, people with better traits for reproduction are more marketable. People who are more physically attractive or make more money tend to have a greater selection of partners.</p>

<p>However, to think of marriage as a market makes it less sacred. If I’m less satisfied with my phone, then I can buy a different brand or different version. But if I’m less satisfied with my spouse, then does that mean I should find another one?</p>

<p>My opinion is that aspects of the free market have seeped into marriage. Marriage is no longer as sacred as we once held it to be. The vows about “death till we part” no long hold any meaning when people start on their third or forth marriages. When the famous Hollywood actress Ingrid Bergman had an affair in Italy in the 1940s, she was publicly shunned. Many United States senators even wrote her to never return to the States. Nowadays, no one bats an eye if a celebrity has an affair. People are used to hearing about divorce as it is so commonplace.</p>

<p>Steven Horwitz’s article “Capitalism and the Family” explains the following points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In agricultural societies, marriages were primarily economically motivated. To survive, children worked in the fields, and men and women had well-defined divisions of labor.</li>
  <li>Wage labor meant families shifted from working in the household to working in the market. Industrial growth meant families became wealthier and could afford to withdraw child labor and female labor from the market.</li>
  <li>The “traditional” family formed as men worked in the public sphere of work, and women worked in the private sphere of the household. Children became consumers rather than producers.</li>
  <li>Technology made household tasks easier pushing women back into the public sphere of work.</li>
  <li>Men and women now both participate in the labor market. They are also wealthier as real wages have increased.</li>
  <li>Romantic love and love-based marriage emerged as economic considerations declined. Thus, the demand for easier ways of leaving marriages increased.</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, these points were interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Today, many people talk about men and women both participating in the labor market as an entirely new idea arising from the last half century. However, during the early stages of the industrial revolution, men and women both worked in the factories. The “traditional” family emerged as a luxury for women to withdraw back into the household. Now the trend is reversing again as women are going back into the labor market.</li>
  <li>The reason for higher divorces rates isn’t no-fault divorce laws. Rather, no-fault divorce laws were the result of the higher demand for easier divorces. The root cause of higher divorce rates was the shift from economically-based marriages to love-based marriages. Emotional fulfillment is more fickle than economic stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the reader, is marriage sacred to you? Why do you think divorces have increased?</p>
