&lt;p&gt;My first complaint is that the contest format encourages “spreading”. Competitors often speak very quickly at 300+ words per minute in order to voice all their arguments. I suppose this is a necessary evil, because if you aren’t doing this, then the competitor will, and you’ll lose because the competitor has voiced more arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I can’t take these arguments seriously if I can’t understand them. Sure, if I were to study how to process words at 300+ words per minute, I’d be able to understand them, but only crazy people would want to learn to understand “spreading” in their free time. It’d be better to add a penalty for incoherent speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second complaint is more trivial, and it’s that the debaters don’t look at each other. I’ve seen a few videos of the debaters standing side-by-side and looking ahead at the judges as they debate. In the real world, you need to make eye contact during conversations, business meetings, negotiations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning debates in this format doesn’t seem to be an achievement worth having.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>levalyn</name></author><summary type="html">I’ve watched a few videos on high school debate, and I think they missed the mark on the point of debate.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dream Big Enough</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/18/dream-big-enough.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dream Big Enough" /><published>2021-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/12/18/dream-big-enough</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/18/dream-big-enough.html">&lt;p&gt;“Wisdom is to have dreams big enough not to lose sight of them when we pursue them” - Oscar Wilde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to have a dream. Many people don’t reach this step, and it is the root of most existential angst. In the workplace, you should set your own goals and agenda, or else your boss will set one for you that’s not in your best interest. In society, if you don’t have a dream, then society will mold a cookie-cutter, conventional life for you. You will let others dictate your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is dream big enough. If the dream can be accomplished in less than a year, then it’s probably not big enough to set as a life mission. Always think ahead to the long term.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>levalyn</name></author><summary type="html">“Wisdom is to have dreams big enough not to lose sight of them when we pursue them” - Oscar Wilde.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Seeking New Perspectives</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/12/seeking-new-perspectives.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Seeking New Perspectives" /><published>2021-12-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/12/12/seeking-new-perspectives</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/12/seeking-new-perspectives.html">&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common advice for people in their 20s is to travel the world, try out different jobs, date around to find what kind of person you like, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a PhD student has spent the month bashing his head over a problem, he will approach his advisor, and the solution will often come easily because the advisor leads the student down an entirely different path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common denominator of these examples is that sometimes the best approach is to try something completely different. We can spend all of our efforts exhausting our existing knowledge, but that limits us from gaining any new knowledge. Perhaps the better way forward is to expand our knowledge, so we have a better idea of what else is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the advice to travel the world, to try out different jobs, and to date around, it is not certain what we will gain out of the experience beforehand. But that is the point. By exploring the unknown, we will expand our horizons in meaningful and unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an anecdotal example, one of my hobbies is learning languages. Learning languages is much more than learning vocabulary and grammar. When you study a language, you study the culture, history, and mentality of a people because these permeate into the creation and evolution of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English, stating your age such as in the sentence, “I am 20 years old”, is done by the “to be” construction, suggesting that a person’s is a characteristic or attribute of a person. Contrast this with Spanish, in which you would instead say “I have 20 years old” or with Russian, in which you would say something to the effect of “20 years is happening to me.” In Spanish, age is an external object which you can possess, and in Russian, age is some abstract thing that acts on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Erich Fromm’s To Have or To Be discusses this aspect of language in more detail in one of the sections in his philosophical thesis on the ideal mode of existence.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot exactly pinpoint how the above difference between English, Spanish, and Russian has influenced me. If I were forced to answer with something, I would sputter some gibberish… rethinking the active versus passive relationship with natural phenomena such as age… individualistic view of self in English versus relational view of self in Russian… I’m not really sure…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to exactly say how this example affects or benefits me, but the point is that the sum of the small tidbits of language and culture has led me to a different way of thinking. In my personal life, I find this process of discovering new perspectives challenging yet immensely enjoyable. In the workplace and in society, I find that I am often able to bring a diverse perspective to the table.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>levalyn</name></author><summary type="html">Some of the most common advice for people in their 20s is to travel the world, try out different jobs, date around to find what kind of person you like, etc.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Is Marriage Still Sacred</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/06/is-marriage-still-sacred.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is Marriage Still Sacred" /><published>2021-12-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/12/06/is-marriage-still-sacred</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/12/06/is-marriage-still-sacred.html">&lt;p&gt;The market economy is the dominant economic force in the Western world. It dictates that supply and demand are the main drivers behind price. This is a fairly intuitive idea - the more sellers of a particular item, the lower the price. And the more buyers, the higher the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For almost every imaginable thing in the world, there is a market for it. Food, housing, stocks, cell phones, water, etc. If you were to take survey of every item in your house, you would find that the vast majority of items have a market for them. If they didn’t, how did you buy them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, the item is some handwoven scarf given as a gift from your grandmother, so it was never bought on the market. But even then, the yarn used in that scarf had to be bought somewhere. And if you wanted to sell the scarf, it would go for some amount on the handmade or secondhand market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about something more abstract like the marriage market? From an evolutionary perspective, people with better traits for reproduction are more marketable. People who are more physically attractive or make more money tend to have a greater selection of partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to think of marriage as a market makes it less sacred. If I’m less satisfied with my phone, then I can buy a different brand or different version. But if I’m less satisfied with my spouse, then does that mean I should find another one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that aspects of the free market have seeped into marriage. Marriage is no longer as sacred as we once held it to be. The vows about “death till we part” no long hold any meaning when people start on their third or forth marriages. When the famous Hollywood actress Ingrid Bergman had an affair in Italy in the 1940s, she was publicly shunned. Many United States senators even wrote her to never return to the States. Nowadays, no one bats an eye if a celebrity has an affair. People are used to hearing about divorce as it is so commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Horwitz’s article “Capitalism and the Family” explains the following points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In agricultural societies, marriages were primarily economically motivated. To survive, children worked in the fields, and men and women had well-defined divisions of labor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wage labor meant families shifted from working in the household to working in the market. Industrial growth meant families became wealthier and could afford to withdraw child labor and female labor from the market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “traditional” family formed as men worked in the public sphere of work, and women worked in the private sphere of the household. Children became consumers rather than producers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technology made household tasks easier pushing women back into the public sphere of work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Men and women now both participate in the labor market. They are also wealthier as real wages have increased.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Romantic love and love-based marriage emerged as economic considerations declined. Thus, the demand for easier ways of leaving marriages increased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, these points were interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Today, many people talk about men and women both participating in the labor market as an entirely new idea arising from the last half century. However, during the early stages of the industrial revolution, men and women both worked in the factories. The “traditional” family emerged as a luxury for women to withdraw back into the household. Now the trend is reversing again as women are going back into the labor market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The reason for higher divorces rates isn’t no-fault divorce laws. Rather, no-fault divorce laws were the result of the higher demand for easier divorces. The root cause of higher divorce rates was the shift from economically-based marriages to love-based marriages. Emotional fulfillment is more fickle than economic stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the reader, is marriage sacred to you? Why do you think divorces have increased?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>levalyn</name></author><summary type="html">The market economy is the dominant economic force in the Western world.
