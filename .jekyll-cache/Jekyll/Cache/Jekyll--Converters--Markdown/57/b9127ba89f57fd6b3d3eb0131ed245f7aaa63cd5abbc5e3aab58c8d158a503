I"Ì<p>Iâ€™ve watched a few videos on high school debate, and I think they missed the mark on the point of debate.</p>

<p>My first complaint is that the contest format encourages â€œspreadingâ€. Competitors often speak very quickly at 300+ words per minute in order to voice all their arguments. I suppose this is a necessary evil, because if you arenâ€™t doing this, then the competitor will, and youâ€™ll lose because the competitor has voiced more arguments.</p>

<p>The problem is that I canâ€™t take these arguments seriously if I canâ€™t understand them. Sure, if I were to study how to process words at 300+ words per minute, Iâ€™d be able to understand them, but only crazy people would want to learn to understand â€œspreadingâ€ in their free time. Itâ€™d be better to add a penalty for incoherent speech.</p>

<p>My second complaint is more trivial, and itâ€™s that the debaters donâ€™t look at each other. Iâ€™ve seen a few videos of the debaters standing side-by-side and looking ahead at the judges as they debate. In the real world, you need to make eye contact during conversations, business meetings, negotiations, etc.</p>

<p>Winning debates in this format doesnâ€™t seem to be an achievement worth having.</p>
